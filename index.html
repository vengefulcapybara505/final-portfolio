            <h1>Final Portfolio <br><br></h1>
            <p>Hi, I am a UI/UX designer whose goal is to create dynamic interfaces that 
                work on hosts of different screen sizes and device types. 
                Coming up with a layout and design for an application is an art and a science. 
                There are proven ways that will make an intuitive and dynamic layout but ultimately it 
                is up to you, the designer, to add your own creative flair and find opportunities to 
                improve the status quo. There is nothing more irritating for me than for an aesthetically 
                pleasing site to not work on various screen sizes. For users who may only have one device, 
                developers need to make sure that they are using best practices to maximize compatibility. 
                An analogy can be made to real life objects such as a door handle. People have a variety of 
                hand shapes and sizes. Such a thing such as a door handle can be ergonomically perfected to 
                create a seamless, intuitive experience, that can used by all users or it can be a haphazard 
                afterthought that leaves the consumer wondering why they use the product in the first place. 
                That is why throughout this portfolio, perfecting the compatibility of my projects and designs 
                was of the utmost importance.
            </p>
