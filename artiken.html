                <p>It's one thing to design a static website, but it's another to make your site interactive.
                    The goal of this project was to practice adding interactivity to our projects using the React JavaScript library. 
                    We had to create an interface
                    that used React components, React state, and lists. The interface had to allow the user
                    to select items out of a list, filter items, and aggregate the selected items.
                </p>
                
                <h2><br><br> My Project <br><br></h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to design a store front for a popular Kenyan bracelet and accessories company called 
                    <a target = "_blank" href="https://artiken.com/">Artiken</a>.
                    I wanted there to be a wide selection of colored bracelets and the user could sort and filter them based
                    on seasonal colors, price, and sales.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I started off by creating the layout of the website. I put the filters and sorters in a little sub 
                    menu on the left side of the page and a list of the item cards on the right hand side. I also put a cart 
                    button on the top right hand corner of the page that also functioned as a display of the cart total.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each item card had the following parts: <br><br>
                </p>
                <div class = "list-div">
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bracelet Picture</li>
                            <li>Bracelet color</li>
                            <li>List of the seasons for that color</li>
                            <li>An add to cart/remove from cart button</li>
                        </ul>
                       
                        <div>
                            <br>
                            <img src="images/itemcard.png" alt="A picture of the item card">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    
                </div>
                
                
                <p>
                    <br><br><br>
                    I added a sorting dropdown for price and filter checkboxes for: <br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="list-div2">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Winter Colors</li>
                        <li>Fall Colors</li>
                        <li>Spring Colors</li>
                        <li>Summer Colors</li>
                        <li>Sale items</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
    
                <p><br>
                    Clicking on the cart button would pull up a detailed view of the items added to the cart and 
                    the and total of the items.
                </p>
    
               <p>Implementing the filters and sorting took the majority of the time and involved using React states and
                higher order functions.
